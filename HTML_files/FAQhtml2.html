                            AF Banking and Investments is one of the first fully decentralized banks, making your money more secure than traditional banks. This is matched with our physical locations which allow us to get the best of both worlds.

                            <div class="Answer">
                            AF Banking and Investments is technically decentralized despite having an open and friendly office, meaning one nation's inflation rates don't affect our personal loan and mortgage interest rates.
